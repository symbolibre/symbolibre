When the key corresponding to an entry is pressed/a entry in a menu is selected, we insert in the text the corresponding sequence of characters ("While :\n", etc )
However, we sometimes want to place the cursor not after what has been inserted, but within the string (example : Python's 'while' is always followed by "<condition>:\n").
To signify where we want the cursor to be placed after the insertion, we add an extra symbol, *, in the string.
It means that those strings can't be inserted directly in the text but need to be pre-processed once :
- If no * symbol is present, we insert the string at the cursor's position in the text, and place the cursor at the end of what has just been added.
- If a * is in the string : we remove it, we insert the string in the text, and we then place the cursor back at the position that was occupied by the *.

It allows us to quickly insert specific keywords, according to the language we are programming with.
